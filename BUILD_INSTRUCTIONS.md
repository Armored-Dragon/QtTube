**Please note that these instructions are far from perfect and will likely be improved upon at a later date.**

First and foremost, you obviously have to clone the repository.  
Just run ``git clone --recursive https://github.com/BowDown097/QtTube`` or use the download ZIP feature I guess if that floats your boat.  
VERY important that recursive flag is there, otherwise you won't be able to build this.

Then, get Qt 5 or 6 (6 recommended) and make sure you have the WebEngine module. Then you should be good to go!

## The build fails on MinGW!
